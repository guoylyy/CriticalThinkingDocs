## 更新原则
1. I must write code every day. I can write docs, or blog posts, or other things but it must be in addition to the code that I write.
2. It must be useful code. No tweaking indentation, no code re-formatting, and if at all possible no refactoring. (All these things are permitted, but not as the exclusive work of the day.)
3. All code must be written before midnight.
4. The code must be Open Source and up on Github.
